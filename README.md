Test Repository
Initial Test Repository for GitHub. This is a potential platform for researching Artificial Intelligence projects for Homeland Security implications.
It should be an interesting journey. I have several college degrees, including a Master's plus 30 hours of Computer Information Technology study and research. I also possess the four top world certifications regarding computer security. The Federal government has employed me and trained me par excellence for the past 21 years.
